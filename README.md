### Gamer-Data
This is app where user can look up games information using an api from rawg and create a collection of games they own and record their state and rating of each game.
This project was a follow on from the animi-data and bugtracking app using their different concepts.From anini-data That project was mainly using an api and displaying the information on my website. Bug tracking app I worked with a database getting and sending data to my database. I combined both of them by getting information from the api and storing information users selected to add to their collection. 

## Lessons Learned
How useEffect actually renders infomation onto the page. 
Using React with a backend (Firebase) and Api. 
understand how firebase stores information. 
using useEffect less for API calls and instead using react query. 


## Potentail future Features
See other users games colection if public to other users. 
rate games in your collection how how satified you were with them. 

## Deployment
Deployed on render with firebase as the database. 

### Working on
Add and improve accessibility on website. 

## Researching 
Better protection on database.
