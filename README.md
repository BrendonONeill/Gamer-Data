### Gamer-Data
This is an app where user's can look up information on video games using an api from RAWG. The user's can also create a collection of games they own and record the games they have played or own. This project was a follow on from the animi-data and bug tracking app using their different concepts. From anini-data That project was mainly using an api and displaying the information on my website. Bug tracking app I worked with a database getting and sending data to my database. I combined both of them by getting information from the api and storing information users selected to add to their collection. 

## Lessons Learned
How react renders and when information will be displayed on the page, I learnt a lot from this project as I didnt fully understand how rendeing worked.  
Using React with a backend (Firebase) and Api. This took a most of my timne as trying to sort data from one place to another and pick the best soluations to provide me the best answers. 
Understanding how firebase stores information. I'm familiar with MongoDB and SQL databases but firebase did it a bit different and I had to get my head around the new way to get data.   
Using useEffect less for API calls and instead using react query. 


## Potentail future Features
See other users games colection if public to other users. 
rate games in your collection how how satified you were with them.  
Set if the game is completed or not. 

## Deployment

### Working on
